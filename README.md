### About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at KAUST, advised by Prof. [Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io) and collaborating closely with Prof. [Yinzhi Cao](https://www.yinzhicao.org) (Johns Hopkins University). My research focuses on **machine unlearning, data/LLM memorization, and related privacy, copyright, and security challenges**.
